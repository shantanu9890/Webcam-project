# Webcam-project
                   This is webcam project code which is made using python and mathematica software. 
                   Basically at the time of online exams, online class or in meetings  there is a need of proctoring .At that time we came to know that many students were joining the class but after joining they were doing other works and not following through the lecture. 
                   This project solves the problem by showing if person is in front of webcam or not. 
                   It produces beep sound when person goes out of webcam and again it beeps after person comes back.
                   It also shows the graph at last . the graph gives information about all the captured moments and shows general mobility.
